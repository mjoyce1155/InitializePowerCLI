# InitializePowerCLI
 The Initialize-PowerCLI function automates the setup of your PowerCLI environment. It verifies that the VMware.PowerCLI module is installed and imports it if necessary, optionally updates the module, and then connects to a vCenter server. If multiple vCenter servers are provided, the function prompts the user to select one.
